This is a browser-based 3D simulation of our solar system built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), a powerful WebGL library. It visualizes all 8 planets orbiting the Sun with realistic lighting, planetary motion, speed control sliders, tooltips, zoom features, and a dark/light theme toggle.

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Core Objectives
- ☀️ Sun at the center of the scene
- 🪐 All 8 planets from Mercury to Neptune orbiting around the Sun
- 🔄 Smooth orbital animation using `requestAnimationFrame`
- 🎥 Custom camera angles and controls
- 💡 Realistic lighting with ambient and point lights

### 🧪 Interactive Controls
- 🎛 Real-time **speed control sliders** for each planet
- ⏸ **Pause/Resume** animation toggle
- 🖱 **Hover tooltips** displaying planet names
- 🌓 **Dark/Light theme** toggle
- 🌌 **Dynamic star background** adapting to theme
- 🔍 **Click on any planet** to zoom in
- 🖱️ **Double-click anywhere** to reset camera view

## 🔧 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Internet connection (Three.js is loaded via CDN)

🎯 Educational Goals
This project helps you learn and demonstrate:

✅ 3D rendering with Three.js

✅ DOM interaction using Vanilla JavaScript

✅ Scene composition, lighting, camera positioning

✅ Real-time updates via animation loop

✅ Theme switching and UI state persistence

✅ Basic user interaction using mouse and raycasting
